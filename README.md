# CodSoft-no.1-Titanic-Survival-prediction
In this Titanic survival prediction project, I developed a machine learning model to forecast whether passengers survived the historic disaster. By analyzing passenger data and employing classification algorithms, I aimed to create an accurate predictive tool for determining survival outcomes. 
In my Titanic survival prediction project, I utilized the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB) algorithm to create a model. This algorithm, which assumes a Gaussian distribution for feature data, helped me make probabilistic predictions on whether passengers survived the tragic event, contributing to the understanding of factors influencing their survival.
